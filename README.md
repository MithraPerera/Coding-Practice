# Practice Problems

## About

I am a big believer in "practice makes perfect" and thus, I aim to practice coding in my languages of choice daily to keep my knowledge and skills sharp. This repo will hold the final iterations of my solutions to problems found on [Exercism](https://www.exercism.org/).

In the words of Bruce Lee,

> "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced 1 kick 10,000 times".
